Hi everyone! My name is Allan, i am from Brazil and always loved computers, games and tecnology, but tryied myself on the sport coach, and then reallized that ain't for me. 
Later on i developed my love for coding at my working looking at Excel and the amazing things i could do with that. 
I just started but i really liked, i hope i can develop myself alot. 
Here i will post some challenges from Front End Mentor and later, i hope, some works :D
If you see anything wrong or just bad writing on my codes, i would love to recieve some critcs.
